# TicTacToe
If you play against the computer, then you will never win.  The computer is a perfect player and will not make a mistake.  The best you can do is tie with the computer.

You run the game with 'python main.py'.

You can choose what type of players X and O are (human or computer).

When choosing to place an X or an O you use the keypad (0-8) to indicate where to place the symbol.  The following diagram will be shown before each turn:

0 | 1 | 2
- + - + -
3 | 4 | 5
- + - + -
6 | 7 | 8

We use the minimax algorithm for the AI.
